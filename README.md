# sgui

Immediate mode UI library written in Odin, with a flex-box style layout algorithm inspired by Clay.
The library is in a very early state.

# Requirements
* Git LFS - on Windows this usually comes bundled with the Git installation, but that's not necessary the case on Linux.
* `stb_truetype`, `sdl2` and `sdl2_image`


# Examples
